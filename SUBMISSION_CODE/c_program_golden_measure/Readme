Program can:

"-x I1 I2"	(XOR mask I1 with I2)
"-a I1 I2" 	(add I1 and I2)
"-s I1 I2" 	(subtract I2 from I1)
"-i I1"		(invert I1)
"-l I1 I2" 	(mask I1 with I2)
"-t I1 f" 	(threshold I1 with integer value f)

To run the program, run make inside the home directory ".../IMM/"
and run the executable file "imageops" with the relevant arguments, for example: for and XOR masking operation use "-x"
`./imageops -x files/shrek_rectangular.pgm files/donkey_mask.pgm output`
will run a masking operation.

Unit testing
The folder /unittesting includes a makefile to compile the unit tests. run ./tests with the necessary 
cath.hpp arguments after compiling. There are a total of 4 test cases but these test cases cover tests
for all aspects of the program (described inside the source code) which include copy and move constructors, 
all image iterator operations and the qualitative test described in the assignment.

Files
/Makefile - makefile for the imageops program
/src/main.cpp - Driver class for the program
/src/image.cpp/image.h - class for the image container together with the nested iterator class
/unittesting/Makefile - makefile for the unit testing
/unittesting/Tests.cpp - program to run unit tests on the imageops program
